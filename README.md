# Chip8-Emulator
Chip 8 emulator I made in C++. (early draft, not polished yet)

# Setup Windows
You will need visual studio to run it out of the box.
After build put SDL2.dll in your executable folder to run the emulator

# Setup PSP
You will need a configured pspsdk to build the psp version 
You can edit run.bat if on windows to run the homebrew with PPSSPP emulator.

Fell free to use this as you want. I mainly made it for training purposes.
